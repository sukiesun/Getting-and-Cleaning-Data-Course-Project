##Descriptions of 89 variables in the tidyData.txt

##Variables [1] to [3] are used to identify the average results of 30 subjects with 6 activities. The total observations are 180 rows for this data set.
 
[1] "subject" 
 The subject is who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
 
[2] "activity"  
 The names of the activities that each person performed, including WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.
 
[3] "y" 
 The ID links the class labels with their activity name.
 
##Variables [4] to [56] are reflecting the average value of each subject and activity combination of the mean measurements of the testing/training results
